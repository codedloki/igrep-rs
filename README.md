igrepigrep is a lightweight, CLI-based pattern searcher written in Rust. It mimics the basic functionality of grep but adds immediate visual feedback by highlighting matching words directly in your terminal.FeaturesInstant Highlighting: Automatically wraps matching patterns in bold green for high visibility.Error Handling: Intelligent argument checking that provides a helpful usage guide if parameters are missing.Memory Efficient: Processes files line-by-line using Rust's lines() iterator.Zero Dependencies: Built entirely with the Rust standard library (std).InstallationTo use igrep, you must have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine.Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/igrep.git
cd igrep
Build the project:Bashcargo build --release
UsageRun the program by passing the target file path and the word you want to search for:Bashcargo run -- &lt;file_path&gt; &lt;word&gt;
ExampleIf you have a file named notes.txt and want to find the word "Rust":Bashcargo run -- notes.txt Rust
Technical OverviewThe tool follows a simple but effective logic flow:Argument Collection: Uses env::args() to capture user input.Validation: Checks if at least two arguments (path and pattern) are provided.File I/O: Reads the entire file content into a string buffer.Pattern Matching: Iterates through each line and uses .contains() to find matches.ANSI Styling: Uses the escape code \x1b[32;1m to inject color before printing the result.Roadmap[ ] Add case-insensitive search support.[ ] Add line numbering for matches.[ ] Support for multiple files.[ ] Regular Expression (Regex) support.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
